Astro Nano is a static, minimalist, lightweight, lightning fast portfolio and blog theme.

Built with Astro, Tailwind and Typescript, an no frameworks.

It was designed as an even more minimal theme than my popular theme [Astro Sphere](https://github.com/markhorn-dev/astro-sphere)

Originally forked from [Astro Nano](https://github.com/markhorn-dev/astro-nano). Modified to use [Keystatic](https://keystatic.com)
